    <h3>Easy tomato soup that's perfect for enjoying as a hearty lunch or
        light dinner</h3>
    <p><em>This simple, quick and easy recipe for homemade fresh tomato soup is perfect to make when tomatoes are ripe
            in
            gardens and farmers' markets for a delicious summertime treat. </em></p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 slice onion</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, large slice of onion, garlic cloves, and chicken
            broth. Bring to a boil, and gently boil for about 20 minutes to blend all of the flavors. Remove from heat
            and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food
            mill.</li>
        <li>In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a roux, cooking until
            the roux is a medium brown. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, so that no lumps form, then stir
            in the rest. Season with sugar and salt, and adjust to taste.</li>

    </ol>
